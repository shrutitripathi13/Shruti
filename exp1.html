                    (INTRODUCTION)
                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and <br>
                    typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's<br>
                    standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown<br>
                    printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a<br>
                    type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,<br>
                    but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining <br>
                    essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with<br>
                    the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,<br>
                    and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus<br>
                    PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.<br>
